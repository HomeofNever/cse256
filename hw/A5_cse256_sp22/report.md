## IBM Model 1

### Description of IBM Model 1 - What are IBM Models used for? What are the limitations?

IBM models are used for translation and alignment, and they have been the majority part of the statistical machine translation systems for a long time. It combines noisy channel model and Expectation-Maximization. For the limitation of the model:

- Each word in the target sentence can at most generated by one word from the source sentence, which does not include the fact that multiple source words would mapped to a single target word
- Model 1 does not consider the word position factor and each word in a sentence are independent, assuming the distortion will be `1/(l+1)` all the time

### Description of EM Algorithm - What are the strengths and weaknesses?



### Method Overview - Provide a high-level description of your implementation

### Results - Report your F1 score. 

### Discussion - Show how F1 score changes after each iteration


## IBM Model 2

### Description of IBM Model 2 - Why is it better than IBM Model 1? What are the limitations?

### Method Overview - Provide a brief, high-level description of your implementation

### Results - Report your F1 score. 

### Discussion

- Show how F1 score changes after each iteration; comment on the findings
- Use the type of table/graph as in the slides or in the instructions, show a correctly aligned example + a misaligned example. Discuss the examples.
